Grade Master Pro: Waterloo Edition

Grade Master Pro is a high-performance academic utility specifically engineered for University of Waterloo students. Built with a "ChatGPT-inspired" clean UI, it streamlines the complex process of grade forecasting and academic planning.

🚀 Key Features

Intelligent Grade Buffing: Automatically implements the "Final Exam replaces lower Mid-term" logic common in Waterloo STEM courses.

Advanced Interpolation Logic: Handles the non-linear "40/60 Rule" (阶梯计算法) used in various Engineering and Math faculties to ensure accurate final grade projections.

Dynamic Category Management: Effortlessly add, weight, and organize assignments, labs, and exams.

Local Persistence: Your data is automatically saved to your browser, allowing for quick adjustments throughout the term without losing progress.

Responsive & Modern UI: A dark-mode, minimalist interface designed for both desktop efficiency and mobile convenience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide-React

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect) with LocalStorage integration.

This project demonstrates my ability to take complex, domain-specific logic (Academic Grading Standards) and translate it into a user-centric digital product.
